## Prerequisities and dependencies
This package uses [![Julia](https://img.shields.io/badge/Julia-v1.10-blue)](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and relies on the following non-standard Julia packages:

      DelimitedFiles        # Provides functionality for reading and writing delimited text files (such as CSV and TSV)
      LinearAlgebra         # Offers a suite of mathematical tools and operations for linear algebra, including matrix       decompositions, norms, and eigenvalues
      Plots                # Provides powerful visualization functions for 2D and 3D plotting with multiple backends (GR, PyPlot, Plotly, etc.)
      Word2vec.jll         # Links to the underlying Word2Vec implementation (C code), enabling fast training and     loading of word embeddings
      Statistics           # Provides functions for basic statistical operations (mean, variance, standard deviation,       correlation, etc.)
      LinearAlgebra        # Offers a suite of mathematical tools and operations for linear algebra (duplicate entry)
      OneHotArrays         # Implements one-hot encoding for categorical data, useful in machine learning and natural  language processing
      Test                 # Juliaâ€™s built-in unit testing framework for writing and running test cases using `@test` and `@testset`
      Plots                # Provides powerful visualization functions for 2D and 3D plotting with multiple backends (duplicate entry)
      Flux                 # A machine learning framework for Julia, offering deep learning capabilities with GPU acceleration and automatic differentiation
      ProgressMeter        # A utility for tracking progress in loops and long computations with progress bars and timers
