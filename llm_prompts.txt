I am programming a julia package for word embeddings using github reository and CI workflow. One principal structure of this package is shown here:

struct WordEmbedding{S<:AbstractString, T<:Real}
    # List of all words in the vocabulary
    # Example: ["cat", "dog", "house"]
    words::Vector{S}
    
    # Matrix containing all word vectors
    # Each column is one word's vector of numbers
    # Size is (vector_dimension √ó vocabulary_size)
    # For 3 words and vectors of length 4 we have a 4√ó3 matrix
    embeddings::Matrix{T}
    
    # Dictionary for fast word lookup
    # Maps each word to its position in the words vector and embeddings matrix
    # Example: "cat" => 1 means first word in vocabulary
    word_indices::Dict{S, Int}
    
    # Makes sure the data is valid and sets everything up correctly
    function WordEmbedding(words::Vector{S}, matrix::Matrix{T}) where {S<:AbstractString, T<:Real}
        # Validate that number of words matches number of vectors
        if length(words) != size(matrix, 2)
            throw(ArgumentError("Number of words ($(length(words))) must match matrix columns ($(size(matrix, 2)))"))
        end
        
        # Create dictionary mapping each word to its position
        indices = Dict(word => idx for (idx, word) in enumerate(words))
        
        # Create new WordEmbedding
        new{S,T}(words, matrix, indices)
    end
end

Below, you find one of the main functions of this package which finds the top n most similar words to a given word or vector based on cosine similarity: 

function get_similar_words(wv::WordEmbedding, word_or_vec::Union{String, Vector{Float64}}, n::Int=10)
    # Make sure input is a vector or convert it into a vector
    vec = get_any2vec(wv, word_or_vec)
    # Computes cosine similarity score between all embedding vectors and input vector
    similarities = wv.embeddings' * vec
    # Sort similarities for highest n cosine similarity scores
    top_indices = sortperm(similarities[:], rev=true)[1:n]
    return wv.words[top_indices]
end

Take an explicit look at this function. Is there anything you would improve. If yes, let me know in detail what and provide your recommendation for a better solution

Your function is well-structured and achieves its goal effectively, but there are some areas for improvement:
Issues and Improvements:

    Numerical Stability with Cosine Similarity
        The cosine similarity formula is:
        cos‚Å°(Œ∏)=A‚ãÖB‚à•A‚à•‚à•B‚à•
        cos(Œ∏)=‚à•A‚à•‚à•B‚à•A‚ãÖB‚Äã
        Your implementation skips normalizing wv.embeddings and vec, which may result in incorrect similarity rankings.
        Solution: Normalize the embeddings and input vector before computing the dot product.

    Handling Edge Cases
        What if word_or_vec is an unknown word? The function should provide a helpful error message.
        What if n is larger than the vocabulary size? The function should return as many words as possible.

    Better Sorting Approach
        sortperm(similarities[:], rev=true)[1:n] sorts the entire array, which is inefficient when only the top n values are needed.
        Solution: Use partial sorting with partialsortperm to efficiently get the top n indices.

    General Type Flexibility
        The function currently assumes Float64 vectors, which might not be ideal for embeddings with other numeric types.
        Solution: Generalize Vector{Float64} to AbstractVector{<:Real}.

Improved Version:

function get_similar_words(wv::WordEmbedding, word_or_vec::Union{String, AbstractVector{<:Real}}, n::Int=10)
    # Convert input to vector (throws error if word is unknown)
    vec = get_any2vec(wv, word_or_vec)

    # Normalize embeddings and input vector to ensure cosine similarity correctness
    norm_embeddings = wv.embeddings ./ sqrt.(sum(wv.embeddings .^ 2, dims=1))  # Column-wise normalization
    norm_vec = vec / norm(vec)

    # Compute cosine similarities
    similarities = norm_embeddings' * norm_vec  # Transpose for correct dot product

    # Ensure n is within valid bounds
    n = min(n, length(wv.words))

    # Use partial sorting to efficiently get top `n` indices
    top_indices = partialsortperm(similarities[:], 1:n, rev=true)

    return wv.words[top_indices]
end

Improvements Explained:

    Proper Cosine Similarity Calculation
        Normalizing both embeddings and the input vector ensures that the similarity metric is mathematically correct.
        Without normalization, raw dot products can give misleading results.

    Error Handling for Unknown Words
        get_any2vec should already handle unknown words, but ensuring that it throws a clear error if needed is good practice.

    Efficient Sorting with partialsortperm
        sortperm(similarities[:], rev=true)[1:n] sorts everything, which is unnecessary.
        partialsortperm(similarities[:], 1:n, rev=true) is much more efficient, as it finds only the n largest values.

    Increased Type Flexibility
        Allowing AbstractVector{<:Real} instead of Vector{Float64} enables the function to work with different numeric types.

Performance Gain Summary:

    Before: Full sorting (O(m log m), where m is vocabulary size)
    After: Partial sorting (O(m + n log n), which is much faster for small n)

Would you like me to review get_any2vec to ensure it‚Äôs robust for this function? üöÄ
You said:
I've had another version of this function which looks like this:

function get_similar_words(wv::WordEmbedding, word_or_vec::Union{AbstractString, Vector{<:Real}}, n::Int=10)
    # Ensure input vector is valid
    vec = get_any2vec(wv, word_or_vec)
    if vec === nothing
        throw(ArgumentError("Word not found in vocabulary, and input is not a valid vector."))
    end

    # Ensure input vector has correct dimension
    if length(vec) != size(wv.embeddings, 1)
        throw(DimensionMismatch("Input vector length ($(length(vec))) does not match word embedding dimension ($(size(wv.embeddings, 1)))"))
    end

    # Normalize the input vector for cosine similarity
    vec = vec / norm(vec)

    # Normalize all embeddings for cosine similarity
    embeddings_normed = wv.embeddings ./ norm.(eachcol(wv.embeddings))

    # Compute cosine similarity
    similarities = embeddings_normed' * vec

    # Efficiently get the top n most similar words
    n = min(n, length(wv.words))  # Avoid requesting more than available words
    top_indices = partialsortperm(similarities, 1:n, rev=true)

    return wv.words[top_indices]
end

Is there a possibility to take the best of both worlds and have a really solid function?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

Yes! Your second version already improves on the first, but we can refine it further by integrating the best parts of both. Below is an optimized and robust version of get_similar_words that combines:

‚úÖ Correct Cosine Similarity Calculation
‚úÖ Efficient Sorting (partialsortperm)
‚úÖ Error Handling (Unknown Words, Dimension Mismatch)
‚úÖ Improved Numerical Stability (Handling Edge Cases)
‚úÖ Increased Type Flexibility
üî• Final Optimized Version

function get_similar_words(wv::WordEmbedding, word_or_vec::Union{AbstractString, AbstractVector{<:Real}}, n::Int=10)
    # Convert input into a vector (or throw an error if word is unknown)
    vec = get_any2vec(wv, word_or_vec)
    
    if vec === nothing
        throw(ArgumentError("Word not found in vocabulary, and input is not a valid vector."))
    end

    # Ensure vector has the correct dimension
    embedding_dim = size(wv.embeddings, 1)
    if length(vec) != embedding_dim
        throw(DimensionMismatch("Input vector length ($(length(vec))) does not match word embedding dimension ($embedding_dim)"))
    end

    # Normalize input vector
    vec_norm = norm(vec)
    if vec_norm == 0
        throw(ArgumentError("Input vector has zero norm, cannot compute cosine similarity."))
    end
    vec = vec / vec_norm  # Safe normalization

    # Normalize all embeddings (column-wise)
    embedding_norms = sqrt.(sum(wv.embeddings .^ 2, dims=1))  # Compute norms for each word vector
    embedding_norms[embedding_norms .== 0] .= eps()  # Avoid division by zero
    embeddings_normed = wv.embeddings ./ embedding_norms  # Normalize each word vector

    # Compute cosine similarities
    similarities = embeddings_normed' * vec  # Dot product of normalized vectors

    # Ensure we don't request more words than available
    n = min(n, length(wv.words))

    # Get top `n` most similar words using efficient sorting
    top_indices = partialsortperm(similarities, 1:n, rev=true)

    return wv.words[top_indices]
end

üöÄ Why is this the best version?

    Handles Unknown Words
        If the word isn‚Äôt in the vocabulary, an informative error is thrown.

    Ensures Proper Dimension Matching
        Checks if the input vector has the correct length before proceeding.

    Improves Numerical Stability
        Adds a safeguard against zero-norm vectors (both input and stored embeddings).
        Uses eps() to prevent division by zero.

    Optimized for Performance
        Computes norms once instead of applying norm.(eachcol(...)), which avoids redundant calculations.
        Uses partialsortperm for efficient retrieval of the top n words.

    Flexible with Different Numeric Types
        Works with any AbstractVector{<:Real} instead of being restricted to Vector{Float64}.

üîç Key Performance Gain

Instead of O(m log m) for full sorting, this version runs in O(m + n log n), making it significantly faster for large vocabularies.

This should be production-ready and highly efficient. üöÄ Let me know if you want additional tweaks!

You said:
Is this a typical way of writing a julia function?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

Yes, this is a typical and idiomatic way of writing a Julia function, especially when optimizing for brevity and performance. Here‚Äôs why:
‚úÖ Idiomatic Julia Style Used in the Function

    Concise Error Handling with &&
        Using && for inline conditionals (e.g., vec === nothing && throw(...)) is common in Julia for short error checks.
        However, for complex conditions or multiple lines, explicit if statements are preferred for readability.

    In-Place Operations for Efficiency
        vec /= vec_norm modifies vec directly, avoiding unnecessary reallocation.
        This aligns with Julia‚Äôs preference for in-place operations where possible.

    Vectorized Computation
        sqrt.(sum(wv.embeddings .^ 2, dims=1)) follows Julia‚Äôs broadcasting convention (.) to operate efficiently on arrays.

    Use of max.(..., eps()) for Numerical Stability
        Helps avoid division by zero when normalizing embeddings.
        This is a good Julia practice for handling floating-point edge cases.

    Efficient Sorting with partialsortperm
        Instead of full sorting (sortperm), using partialsortperm for top n elements is a very Julian way to improve efficiency.

‚ö†Ô∏è When to Avoid This Style?

While this compact form is great for performance-critical code, it can reduce readability in longer or more complex functions. Here‚Äôs when you might want to expand it:

    For beginner-friendly code ‚Üí More explicit if statements improve readability.
    For long or multi-step logic ‚Üí Avoid chaining multiple inline conditions.
    For debugging-heavy functions ‚Üí Explicit intermediate variables make debugging easier.

üî• Alternative (More Readable) Version

If you prefer a more explicit style while keeping things efficient:

function get_similar_words(wv::WordEmbedding, word_or_vec::Union{AbstractString, AbstractVector{<:Real}}, n::Int=10)
    vec = get_any2vec(wv, word_or_vec)
    if vec === nothing
        throw(ArgumentError("Word not found in vocabulary, and input is not a valid vector."))
    end

    embedding_dim = size(wv.embeddings, 1)
    if length(vec) != embedding_dim
        throw(DimensionMismatch("Vector length ($(length(vec))) does not match embedding dimension ($embedding_dim)"))
    end

    vec_norm = norm(vec)
    if vec_norm == 0
        throw(ArgumentError("Input vector has zero norm, cannot compute cosine similarity."))
    end
    vec /= vec_norm  # Normalize input

    embedding_norms = sqrt.(sum(wv.embeddings .^ 2, dims=1))
    embeddings_normed = wv.embeddings ./ max.(embedding_norms, eps())

    similarities = embeddings_normed' * vec
    top_indices = partialsortperm(similarities, 1:min(n, length(wv.words)), rev=true)

    return wv.words[top_indices]
end

‚úî Still efficient, but easier to read
‚úî Explicit error handling with if statements
Summary

    ‚úÖ Compact form ‚Üí Common in Julia, useful for high-performance functions.
    ‚úÖ Explicit form ‚Üí More readable, better for maintainability.
